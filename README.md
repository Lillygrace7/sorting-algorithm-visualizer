# Sorting algorithm visualizer

A sorting algorithm visualizer demonstrating real-time sorting, comparisons, and complexity analysis, built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

## Highlights

* **Tech Stack:** Built with pure HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript.

* **Multiple Algorithms:** Includes Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, and Quick Sort.

* **Performance monitor:** Tracks Comparisons, Swaps, and Big O Complexity as the sort runs.

* **Step Mode:** Use the "Next" button to move through the logic one swap at a time.

* **Responsive UI:** Modern dark mode design using CSS Flexbox and Grid.

## Overview

SortViz Pro makes sorting easy by turning array operations into an animation. It uses JavaScript Async/Await to control the animation speed, allowing you to see exactly when two elements are compared or swapped.

**How the colors work:**

* **Indigo:** Default state.

* **Red:** Current elements being compared.

* **Yellow:** Elements being swapped/moved.

* **Green:** Elements in their final, sorted position.
